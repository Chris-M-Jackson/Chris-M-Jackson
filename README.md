- 👋 Hi, I’m @Chris-M-Jackson
- 👀 I’m interested in a potential career in Web Devlopement, as I like making websites and want to make more advanced looking ones in the future.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can make better once I learn enough to do so.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a high school senior.
